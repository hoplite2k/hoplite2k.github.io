This system is designed in favor of the hostel management which helps them to save the records of
the students about their rooms and other things. It helps them from the manual work from which it
is very difficult to find the record of the students and the mess bills of the students, and the
information about those who had left the hostel three years before. We design this system on the
request of the hostel management, through this they cannot require such an efficient person to
handle and calculate the things. This system automatically calculates all the bills and issues the
notifications for those students who are against some rules.

<b>* Terminology</b>

A) MongoDB: Cross-platform Document-Oriented Database​: MongoDB is a NoSQL
database where each record is a document consisting of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON
(JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema,
databases, tables, etc. Documents that are identifiable by a primary key make up the basic unit of
MongoDB. Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of the Mongo shell as well. Mongo
shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact and carry out
operations (eg: querying, updating records, deleting records).

B) Express: Back-End Framework: ​Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the
code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to
write the back-end code. Express helps in designing great web applications and APIs. Express
supports many middlewares which makes the code shorter and easier to write.

C) React: Front-End Library: React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user
interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications
because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavasScript
and create UI components.

4) Node.js: JS Runtime Environment: Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which
allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm
allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages (node modules) to download.

<b>* Purpose</b>

This system is designed in favor of the hostel management which helps them to save the records
of the students about their rooms and other things. It also helps them store details related to mess,
like the ration consumed, food wastage and other things. It helps them from the manual work
from which it is very difficult to find the record of the students and the mess bills of the students,
and the information about those who had left the hostel.

<b>* Motivation</b>

Hostel is not less than a home for students when staying away from their home. It has large
well ventilated dormitories and single rooms and is situated in the school premises. Providing
clean and calm hostel accommodation is one of the key responsible of school
management.To manage the hostel facilities, a lot of data need to be maintained such as
number of student hostel can accommodate, hostel rules and regulation, hostel fee, hostel in
and out of student, guest and visitor record and so on. So, this needs the system which has an
ability to capture all kinds of data and information and analyze it properly for smooth
functioning of the hostel. Hostel wardens can easily maintain the data.

<b>* Problem Statement</b>

After making an observation on the current process of hostel management at school, it found that
every single thing is done completely by manual. Currently, the decision is to make a
computerized system . It is because they are facing problems such as corruption of data. The data
about student hostels are stored and kept not very well and systematically. In the current process,
the data is stored into the file but not in the database which leads to data duplication, repetitive
data, and isolation of data from one to another. It is also worried if something happens to the file,
then all the data will be lost.In the current manual system, it will be very difficult to find the
hostel records and other information of students manually. Because it has been kept on the paper
and it is easy to lose. It also consumes time to search the paper of the student hostel record one
by one.The manual system requires longer time for allocation the student to respective hostel,
dorm, and bed.

<b>* Objective</b>

(i)To develop an integrated system for the hostel management system.
(ii)Providing a facility for wardens to manage hostel and mess data.
(iii)To compare the efficiency of system design for a small IT project.

<b>* Scope and Relevance</b>

The proposed system for “Hostel and Mess Database Management System” is computerized.
Today is the era of computers. This software project solves all the problems discussed above in
the present system. The main objective of developing this project is to save time and efforts. The
proposed system provides features on different tasks like, All the details related to hostelites can
be found at one place like the admission details, fees details, room details , parent details ,mess
details etc. All the details related to a mess employees and mess can be found here and managed
by the wardens. The product will be useful to - Warden – To be able to alter and view student,
employee, mess details. Mess Employee – To be able to view student details and view, alter
mess details.
